This repository contains the RESTful API information for the OpenStack Image Service, also known as Glance. The Glance project provides services for discovering, registering, and retrieving virtual machine images. The Image Service has a RESTful API that allows querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image.

VM images made available through Glance can be stored in a variety of locations from simple filesystems to object-storage systems like the OpenStack Swift project.
